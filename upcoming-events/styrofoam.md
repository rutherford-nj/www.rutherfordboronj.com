The Green Team & DPW will be holding a foam collection drive collecting clean, rigid, packaging polystyrene (styrofoam) at the the DPW, 227 Highland Cross.

The material collected will be recycled locally, please do not put styrofoam in your blue bins for recycling - it cannot be processed by our recycling vendor, and can only be recycled at specialty events like this one. Can't make this event? Look out for our next collection in the summer in connection with Shred Day.
