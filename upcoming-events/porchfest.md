PorchFest is back for 2024! Now seeking applicants from musicians, porch owners and volunteers!

Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee is currently seeking homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a fantastic community event. 

**Now seeking volunteers!**
