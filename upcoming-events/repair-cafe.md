Volunteer experts will help you repair household items. [See Flyer Here](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.rutherford-nj.com/committees/green-team/posts/repaircafeFB.pdf)

Volunteers will have the right tools, but if possible, bring any needed parts. One item (or two knives) at a time. Sevice is first-come, first-served.
