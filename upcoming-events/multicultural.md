The Rutherford Civil Rights Commission is proud to welcome you to the 19th annual
Rutherford Multicultural Festival — Rutherford’s fun, free, family-friendly celebration of
diversity — taking place this year on Sept 8 and 9.

Save the date and join us for a weekend of live music, dancing, art, spoken word, food
and vendors from around the world!

If you would like to join us as an official festival sponsor, vendor or exhibitor, please get

and all are welcome!
