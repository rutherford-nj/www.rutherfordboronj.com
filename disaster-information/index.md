If you are a New Jersey resident whose home was damaged by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, FEMA recommends inspecting your heating, ventilation, air conditioning system (HVAC), furnaces, septic systems and/or wells to see if they were affected.

You may be eligible for financial assistance under FEMAâ€™s Individuals and Households Program.

If you have applied for FEMA assistance and 14 days have passed and you have not had a home inspection, call the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362. When you have your inspection, let the FEMA inspector know you have a private well and/or septic system that may have been damaged by the storm. If you have registered and your house has already been inspected, call the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362 for instructions on how to appeal.
