**The annual spring drive of the Rutherford Community Blood Bank will be held Monday, April 23 from 3-8PM at the Elks Club in Rutherford, NJ.** 

Walk-ins are welcome, but pre-registration is available by visiting [https://donor.cbsblood.org/donor/schedules/drive_schedule/47712](https://donor.cbsblood.org/donor/schedules/drive_schedule/47712) or calling 201-251-3703. Community Blood Services (CBS) of Montvale is the blood bank's professional partner. 

The Rutherford Community Blood Bank is an all-volunteer, community-based organization established in 1957. It is one of CBS’s longest running community blood banks. Blood bank Chairperson Frank Tidona attributes its longevity to the enduring commitments of its notably generous donors, many of whom have been giving blood for many years. “The blood bank sponsors the drives with the help of numerous community members, but it is our outstanding donors, old and new, who make the success of the drawings possible.” 

Prospective donors are invited to complete the required information form in advance by using the Donor Express feature at the CBS website, [www.communitybloodservices.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180413174325/http://www.communitybloodservices.org/). Individuals who are sixteen or seventeen should visit the site to obtain a parental consent form. 


The Elks Club is located at 48 Ames Avenue, less than a block from Park Avenue.


The Rutherford Community Blood Bank has been saving lives for more than sixty years. It is one of the longest running blood banks of its kind.
