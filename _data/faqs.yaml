        Some questions we will ask:

        * What type of work is being done?
        * Is this a single family/multifamily/commercial property?
        * A construction Permit Application will be given to the applicant and this must be filled out completely before we can take it in.
        * If the job requires it, two signed and sealed sets of sketches, drawings, plans, as well as any other documentation of the proposed work will be submitted for review along with the permit applications.
        * Plans will not be reviewed without the applications alongside"
    - heading: "Other items to note for permit process:" 
      text: |
        The applicant must wait for permit approval to start any work.

        The building department legally has 20 business days after submittal to issue the permit, however this process does not normally take this long unless there are incompletions with the application. If there are comments from any of the subcode officials these will be communicated promptly to the applicant.

        Once the permit is approved the applicant will receive a phone call to pick up and pay for the permit. The permit will be issued when and only when the permit is paid for. After payment is received, the project may commence.

        The applicant will receive a placard to be placed in a location easily visible from the street, such as a front window.

        Plans, if any, must be kept at the site at all times. This is so the inspector can compare the work being conducted to the approved plans. Please note that the inspector will not conduct an inspection without those plans on site.

        For a more detailed view of any and all requirements please see the [UCC Construction Official Commentary](https://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/publications/pdf_licensing/co_comment.pdf).

      text: |
        It is the Rutherford’s official emergency alert and notification system. This system is used to send alerts to the public during emergencies.
        It is a free service that allows you to sign up online to receive customized alerts via text message, email, and voice message. 
        In addition to emergency alerts, you can also choose to receive customizable community notifications.
        These include notifications about events, road closures, Police and DPW matters and more. This service is provided by Rutherford at no cost to the public;
        however, message and data rates may apply.
    - heading: "Why should I sign-up for Rutherford Alerts and Notifications?"
      text: |
        When emergencies happen, be the first to know. This system sends official, real-time alerts to the public with information
        about potentially life-saving actions they may need to take to keep themselves and their families safe. By signing up, you
        are taking a large step toward improving your personal safety.
    - heading: "How does it work?"
      text: |
        When an emergency occurs that meets the criteria for sending out an alert to the public, Rutherford’s emergency dispatchers will
        gather the necessary information and push out an alert to the affected area. Alerts can be sent out Borough-wide to everyone who
        has opted-in to the system, or to a specific area or neighborhood for more localized events.
    - heading: "How much does it cost?"
      text: |
        This service is provided by the Borough of Rutherford at no cost to the public; however,
        message and data rates may apply depending on your provider and phone services.
    - heading: "Can you guarantee that I will receive notification if I register?"
      text: |
        While Rutherford Alerts and Notifications powered by Smart911 is an excellent system, we cannot guarantee that you will receive
        notification in all cases. Disasters and emergencies are chaotic and unpredictable, and notification is dependent on external providers
        such as your wireless carrier or email delivery service outside the Rutherford’s control. The system will use several means of
        communications to try to ensure that should any one communications method, technology, or delivery option be unavailable to reach residents,
        other methods will be used to improve the likelihood that citizens will see the message.
