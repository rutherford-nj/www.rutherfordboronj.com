Home fires are preventable! The following are simple steps that each of us can take to prevent a tragedy.

**Most Importantly:**

- Call 9-1-1 immediately in the event of fire or smoke.

- Never use extension cords for portable heaters or any other appliances.

- Follow the manufacturers use instructions when using portable or auxiliary heaters.

**Cooking**

- Stay in the kitchen when you are frying, grilling or broiling food. If you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time turn off the stove.

- Wear short, close-fitting or tightly rolled sleeves when cooking.

- Position barbecue grills at least 10 feet away from siding and deck railings, and out from under eaves and overhanging branches.

- Keep a fire extinguisher available.

**Electrical and Appliance Safety**

- Frayed wires can cause fires. Replace all worn, old or damaged appliance cords immediately and do not run cords under rugs or furniture.

- If an appliance has a three-prong plug, use it only in a three-slot outlet. Never force it to fit into a two-slot outlet or extension cord.

- Immediately shut off, then professionally replace, light switches that are hot to the touch and lights that flicker.

**Portable Space Heaters**

- Keep combustible objects at least three feet away from portable heating devices.

- Buy only heaters evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL).

- Check to make the portable heater has a thermostat control mechanism and will switch off automatically if the heater falls over.

- Only use crystal clear K-1 kerosene in kerosene heaters. Never overfill it. Use the heater in a well-ventilated room.

**Fireplaces and Woodstoves**

- Inspect and clean woodstove pipes and chimneys annually and check monthly for damage or obstructions.

- Use a fireplace screen heavy enough to stop rolling logs and big enough to cover the entire opening of the fireplace to catch flying sparks.

- Make sure the fire is completely out before leaving the house or going to bed.

**Children**

- Take the mystery out of fire play by teaching children that fire is a tool, not a toy.

- Store matches and lighters out of children's reach and sight, preferably in a locked cabinet.

- Never leave children unattended near operating stoves or burning candles, even for a short time.

**More Prevention Tips**

- Never use a stove range or oven to heat your home.

- Keep combustible and flammable liquids away from heat sources.

- Portable generators should NEVER be used indoors and should only be refueled outdoors and in well ventilated areas.
