**Bergen County Mosquito Control will be performing an early morning ULV Truck Spray in Rutherford on Wednesday September 8, 2021 between the hours of 4-6 AM.** 

We will be spraying duet adulticide to eliminate active, adult mosquitoes as well as Vectobac larvacide to help control the mosquito larvae. 

As a precaution, keep your windows closed during this time. In the event that it rains, the spray will be postponed until the following day. 

The safety data sheets for the County's materials being used are below:
