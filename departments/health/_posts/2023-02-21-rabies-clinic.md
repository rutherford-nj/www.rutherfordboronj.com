Registration forms can be picked up in advance at the Health Department located at 184 Park Avenue, between 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM on weekdays or at Police Headquarters after normal working hours.

All cats and dogs must be accompanied by an adult and restrained on a leash or in a carrier. 

Please click on the link to determine if your dog or cat will receive a 1-year or 3-year vaccination. [https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/documents/duration_of_immunity_nov2016.pdf](https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/documents/duration_of_immunity_nov2016.pdf)

IF AN ANIMAL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY VACCINATED, PROOF OF THE PRIOR IMMUNIZATION WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A 3-YEAR VACCINATION CERTIFICATE AT THE RABIES CLINIC.

The State Health Department encourages those owners of animals whose vaccination expires next year to be vaccinated this year to ensure a good overlap in immunity.  This will prevent pet owners from missing the 3-year re-vaccination date, causing their pet’s vaccination to expire.  

A member of the Police Department will also be present during the course of the Rabies Clinic so that unlicensed dogs and cats can be registered by their owners after receiving the Rabies Vaccination.
