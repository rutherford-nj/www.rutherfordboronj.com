**The Rutherford Health Department will be conducting two Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Programs for residents on

The first seasonal influenza vaccination program is ONLY for residents 65 years of age and older and will be held on
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 between the hours of 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. Proof of age will be required to be provided
and no one under 65 years of age will be vaccinated at this program during those hours.

A second seasonal influenza vaccination program will also be held on Wednesday, October 27, 2021, between the hours
of 4:30 and 6:30 PM for ages 18 years and older.

**Residents should be aware of the following due to COVID-19 concerns:**

1- Seating is NOT available and those who have difficulty in standing are encouraged to arrive one hour after
the start of the program.

2- Residents will be required to social distance (6 feet apart) outside the health department and wear a face
covering. Residents are asked to bring their own pen to fill out the consent form.

3- A limited number of participants will be allowed in the health center at any given time.

4- No one should attend the program if they have been ill within the past 48 hours.

5- Residents will be required to complete a “CDC Facilities COVID-19 Screening” form prior to entering
health center.

Both programs will be held at the Rutherford Health Department, 184 Park Avenue, Rutherford, New Jersey.
Two hundred and fifty (250) doses of vaccine are available for the programs and will be provided on a first come first
