title: "Multi-Phasic Blood Screening Program 10/2"

---

The Rutherford Health Department will sponsor a Multi-Phasic Blood Screening Program for Rutherford residents, 18 years of age or older, to be held at the Health Center, 184 Park Avenue, Rutherford, New Jersey. The Blood Screening is scheduled for the morning hours of Saturday, October 2, 2021. Appointments are required and can be made by calling the Public Health Nurses at 201-460-3020 between the hours of 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM, Monday-Friday. Walk-in
appointments will also be taken during the same time period. 

Residents who have participated at previous blood screening programs, failed to contact their licensed medical doctor in a timely manner, and failed to respond to Health Department follow-up letters on abnormalities will not be eligible for this program. The main objective of the program is to detect any abnormalities in the blood. The screening will check for approximately thirty (30) different items, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose. There will be a nominal fee of $22.00 which will cover the cost of the laboratory analysis. For an additional fee, the following tests can be added:

T4/TSH (two thyroid tests), Vitamin D level, Hemoglobin A1-C, Blood Type, PSA, and C- reactive protein. Please call office for the price of each additional test. 

The exact cash amount, check or money order made payable to the Rutherford Health Department, will be appreciated the day of the Screening. This program should only be used as a screening device and not as a self-diagnostic tool or in place of an examination by a licensed medical doctor. A copy of the results will be mailed to the participants and their doctor. Those participants with test results outside the normal range will be required to follow up with their Licensed Medical doctor.
