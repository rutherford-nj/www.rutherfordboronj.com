title: "Flu Vaccine Doses Still Available"
---


The Rutherford Health Department is pleased to report that they still have additional doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine and are opening the program to all residents three years (3) of age and older, free of charge. The vaccine will also be available to non-residents at a cost of $18.00 per dose.

Flu seasons are unpredictable and can be severe. Over a 30 year period of time, estimates of annual flu associated deaths in the United States range from a low of 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people.

Most of the time seasonal flu activity peaks in January, February or later. It is not too late to receive the influenza vaccine and reduce your chances of getting the flu. Those interested in receiving the vaccine can contact the public health nurses weekdays between 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM at 201-460-3020 for additional information.
