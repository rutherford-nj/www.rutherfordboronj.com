title: "Pap Screening Program 10/6"

---

The Rutherford Health Department will sponsor a Pap Screening Program which includes a breast and pelvic exam and a cervical smear for a Pap Test starting at 4:30 PM on Wednesday, October 6, 2021. Appointments are required. 

The Screening will be held at the Health Center, 184 Park Avenue, and is a community service for eligible residents. Eligibility is contingent on being 18 years of age or older, those who have not had a Pap Test within one year, and not under the care of a Gynecologist for a specific illness. 

There will be a reduced fee of $36.00 which will cover the laboratory analysis of the thin prep pap test. When applicable, there will be an additional charge of $25.00 for an HPV Screening. Consetta Cheatam, who has volunteered her services, will be conducting the screening program. For further information on this program and to make an appointment please contact the Public Health Nurses at 201-460-3020, between the hours of 1:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.
