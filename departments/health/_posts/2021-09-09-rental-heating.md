title: "Heating Season For Rental Units"
---


The Rutherford Health Department reminds residents residing in an apartment in the
Borough of Rutherford that the heating season for rental units commenced on October
1st.

Rental units that receive heat, provided by the owner, are required to be at 70 degrees
between 6:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M. and 65 degrees from 11:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M. from
October 1st to May 1st.

Tenants who feel that their apartments are not at the proper degree of heat should have an
accurate thermometer in their unit to verify the actual room temperature. Efforts should
be made by the tenant with the owner, manager, or superintendent of the apartment
complex to correct any heating deficiencies. When those efforts have failed, the
Rutherford Health Department can be reached weekdays between 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.
at 201-460-3020 for assistance.
