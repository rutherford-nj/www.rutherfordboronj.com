**LGBTQ+**
 
The LGBTQ+ community is diverse and made up of different experiences, identities, and challenges. However, members of the community are disproportionately at-risk for suicide and other mental health struggles. This section has information and resources for yourself and to help support loved ones who identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.

**Veterans**
 
For those that serve or who have served, crises can be heightened by their experiences during military service. If you’re a veteran or service member and in crisis, these resources can help.
