If you'd like a very special child who lives in Rutherford to receive a letter in the mail from the North Pole this holiday season, please provide the information below by MIDNIGHT, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 12TH. The elves, with the help of the Rutherford Rec Department, are working very hard at getting the letters in the mail and to the child's house by December 25th.
