# Borough of Rutherford Preliminary Permit Application for Events & Activities on Borough Property


If youâ€™d like to host any event at any Borough property or park, the preliminary application below must be filled out and submitted to the Rutherford Rec Dept a minimum of 8 weeks prior to the event. Approval cannot be guaranteed for permits submitted less than 8 weeks prior to the event. Completion of this form does not signify approval. Once your application has been reviewed, we will contact you with any questions or concerns as well as the fees for your permit. The permit holder will be required to provide a Certificate of Insurance. COVID Acknowledgement forms will also be required for every participant. Some events will require approval of the Mayor & Council. All fees will be assessed after approval.

Please know that the Borough is working hard to provide recreational activities to our residents as safely as possible as we navigate COVID-19 protocol together.  We thank you in advance for your cooperation in responsibly hosting your event. 

All permits are subject to change according to any future Executive Orders by the Governor and local guidelines.
