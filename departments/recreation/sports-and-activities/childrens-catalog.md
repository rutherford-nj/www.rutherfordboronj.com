## 2020 Children's Sports and Activities
**Registration is open and on a First Come, First Served Basis.  The Borough is working hard to provide recreational activities to our residents as safely as possible as we navigate COVID-19 protocol together. As such, the Rec Department is currently offering a limited list of sports and activities.**
