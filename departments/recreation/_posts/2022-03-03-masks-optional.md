title: Masks Optional Beginning 3/7
---

As of Monday, March 7th, the Rutherford School District will make mask wearing optional when in school buildings. Therefore, beginning March 7th, Rutherford Rec spectators, players and coaches will no longer be required to wear a mask when in Rutherford public school buildings. 

Masks remain optional, and anyone who wants to continue to wear a mask can do so. Parents should make masking decisions based on their familyâ€™s specific situation and comfort level.

The Recreation Department will continue to work closely with the Rutherford Health Department to monitor the health and safety of our program participants as it relates to COVID . If any Recreation participant is COVID-19 positive please contact the Rutherford Health Department at 201-460-3120.
