title: Masks Required On School Property
---

We are so happy to be back playing games! We are pleased that the majority of fans are following the protocol of wearing a mask while while in school gyms. 

We have noticed that some fans are not consistent with mask wearing. We are following the [Governorâ€™s Executive Order 251](https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-251.pdf) which requires mask wearing while on school property.  

When indoors, masks must be worn by anyone who is not actively participating in a sport. Please come prepared with your own mask upon entering a gym.

We will be closely monitoring adherence to mask policy throughout this week, and will make a determination if spectators will be allowed at games based on adherence of rule.

Please help us to keep our program healthy.
