**The 6th Annual Rutherford PBA Foot Pursuit takes place this year on October 22, 2017.**

Those that joined us last year will remember a great day that raised funds for three wonderful causes. This year we will be raising money to proceed the Rutherford PBA Local #300 as well as The Ersalesi Scholarship Fund. Last year we had a great turnout!! Those that join us this year can expect the same fun-filled day that includes a DJ, post-race BBQ and fun activities that families can enjoy together.
