Friday, September 2nd 2022

Dear Rutherford Residents -

We recently closed registration for the fall soccer season and, unfortunately, do not have the necessary number of volunteer coaches to support all players participating on some levels.

**THE LACK OF VOLUNTEER COACHES WILL RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OF THE FALL 2022 SOCCER SEASON FOR THE FOLLOWING GROUPS:**

Third and Fourth Grade Girls – Need 2 Coaches

Fifth and Sixth Grade Boys – Need 2 Coaches

Fifth and Sixth Grade Girls – Need 2 Coaches

**The Rutherford Recreation soccer program is volunteer dependent – PLEASE HELP KEEP SOCCER ON THE FIELD!**

Contact the Rutherford Recreation Department by Tuesday September 6th at NOON, if you are interested in being a Volunteer Coach for Soccer.

Please email your name, child’s name (gender & grade), phone number and contact information to: recstaff@rutherfordboronj.com

All coaches must be Rutgers Certified (it is a one-time class with a lifetime certification). Free Classes will be available to all volunteers.

Thank you,

Pat Bonner

Director, Rutherford Recreation Department
