    The Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is responsible for the planning and coordination of activities during natural disasters and other emergencies. Operating under an emergency operations plan, the OEM coordinates the activities of emergency service units during these incidents.
  </div>
  <div>
    Auxiliary police officers serve as a adjunct to the OEM in emergencies and also assist the police department during parades, festivals and other community events. As volunteers who hold other jobs, these individuals are a valuable resource to the community whenever they are needed.
