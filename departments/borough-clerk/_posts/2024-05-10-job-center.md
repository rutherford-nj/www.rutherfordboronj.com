ON-THE-JOB TRAINING (OJT) The Bergen County Job Center’s (BCJC) youth program offers work experience to youth entering
the workforce. The goal of this program is to assist candidates ages 16-24 with hands-on training,
developing soft skills, and what is necessary in order to attain the employer's expectations.

The Youth Program Counselor will be the liaison between the Bergen County Job Center and the
employer to ensure all the employer needs are being addressed. The Program Counselor will visit the
worksite at least once a month to discuss the clients progress and to ensure all employer needs are being
met.

If a candidate is accepted by the employer, a worksite agreement will be completed by both the employer
and the Bergen County Job Center prior to the candidate starting the employment. All company
procedures for a new hire would be expected to be adhered to as well.
