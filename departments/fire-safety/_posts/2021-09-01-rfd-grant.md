On Wednesday August 25, 2021 Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. of the 9th Congressional District announced the Rutherford Fire Department was awarded Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG). This grant totaling $238,095.24 will be utilized to upgrade Fire Department communication systems including mobile and portable radios for fire apparatus and Fire Department personnel.

Fire Chief Dennis Gentile would like thank Former Fire Chief John P. Melfa for his tireless efforts in gathering information and data and writing the grant which lead to a successful grant award for the communications equipment.

Former Chief Melfa has been a member of the Rutherford Fire Department for over 30 years, is a retired Jersey City Fire Captain and currently works as a part time Fire Inspector in the Bureau of Fire Safety.

John has worked on several other grants in the past which have been awarded to the Rutherford Fire Department including grants for communication equipment and personal protective firefighting gear. Outstanding work John!!

The Chief Gentile also recognizes the work of Assistant Chief Moshe Stareshefsky and all the Fire Department officers who may have participated in this project.

This work is an example of the efforts of the officers and members of the Fire Department who work tirelessly to improve the Rutherford Fire Department to better serve our residents and our community
