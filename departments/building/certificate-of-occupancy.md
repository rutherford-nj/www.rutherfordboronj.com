- Notice to all homeowners

The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs’ (DCA) Division of Fire Safety is informing residents of a new smoke alarm regulation, effective January 1, 2019, which requires 10‐year sealed battery smoke alarms be installed in homes built before January 1, 1977. The requirement includes one‐ and two‐family dwellings, motel rooms, and housing units in rooming houses. The State’s Uniform Construction Code requires all homes built after January 1, 1977 to have alternating current (ac) hardwired alarms installed inside the dwellings, and those homes are not affected by the new regulation.
