You may have received a mailer regarding the new NJ state mandate regarding Lead Hazard Testing. The Borough of Rutherford has partnered with LEW Environmental Services to ensure compliance with New Jerseyâ€™s new Lead Safe Certification Law.

The new law states that certain rental properties in Rutherford Borough are required to have a visual inspection to assess for lead hazards.

If you received a notice, please follow the link below to determine if your property requires a lead-based paint inspection.

**Questions about the law or questions about determining if your property is exempt from the law should be directed to LEW Environmental Services.**
