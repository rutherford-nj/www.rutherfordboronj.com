The link to the online tax payment page has also been permanently added to the Borough's home page in addition to the Tax Collector's page and the Department of Finance's page. 

This is offered as another option to residents, who will still be able to pay by cash or check in person at Borough Hall or by the US mail.  

Electronic Payments must be received by 4:15 pm each business day in order to be processed on that day; payments made after this cut-off time will be processed the following business day and interest, if applicable, will be charged accordingly. 

For those who wish to take advantage of this option the following fees will be assessed:

* $1.00 convenience fee for Checking Account-ACH payments (“e-checks”). 

* 2.45% fee per credit card payments which will be based on the amount of the tax payment (The minimum fee is $3.00). This is collected by a 3rd party facilitator. 

American Express, Discover, Master Card and Visa are currently being accepted.
