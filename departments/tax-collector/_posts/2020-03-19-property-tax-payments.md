Property Tax Payments

Please be advised that the Borough of Rutherford Tax Collectorâ€™s Office is open by appointment ONLY as is all of Borough Hall.  While many of you normally visit the office, we are encouraging all property owners to take advantage of alternate methods for tax payments.  The Borough has made the following options available to you in lieu of paying in-person:

- Mail your tax payment;

- Place your payment in the Drop Box located by the Donaldson Avenue entrance of Borough Hall;

- Pay your taxes via our [on-line payment portal here.](https://www.cit-e.net/rutherford-nj/cn/TaxBill_Std/?tpid=15571) 

- If you are a Senior Citizen / Disabled Individual (or assisting a Senior or Disabled person) and eligible for the Property Tax Reimbursement program (aka Senior Freeze), the Tax Office has the ability to print our portion of the application from our computer and mail it to you.

Please call the Tax Office at 201-460-3005 for further information. Office hours are 8:30 - 4:30.

Please practice social distancing, frequent hand sanitizing and all other precautions to remain healthy.
