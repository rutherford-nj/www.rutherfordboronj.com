title: "Estimated 3rd Quarter Tax Bills Mailed"
---

**The Borough of Rutherford has mailed out estimated bills for the 3rd quarter of 2016.**

These taxes must be paid no later than August 10, 2016, to avoid interest.

We now offer the convenience of paying by ACH or “e-check” and credit card- online only.

Please visit [this page](https://www.cit-e.net/rutherford-nj/cn/TaxBill_Std/?tpid=15571) for further details and associated charges.

There is also a lock box, located on the driveway side of Borough Hall for after-hours drop-off. 

Any payment received after 4:15 PM is considered processed as of the next business

day, and interest, if applicable, will be charged accordingly.
