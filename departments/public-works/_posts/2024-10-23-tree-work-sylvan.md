Dear Residents: 

In order to keep our roadways in top condition, a road improvement project is typically undertaken yearly. As part of that program, pre-paving concrete work is required. Many of our road projects receive funding on a state or county level. These programs strictly specify replacement of handicapped ramps along with curbing, sidewalks, and driveway aprons as needed. 

As you are aware, many of our trees are quite large and some have outgrown the planting area, known as the “tree belt,” and have already caused damages to the existing curbs and sidewalks.  
 
Unfortunately, there will be trees that need to be removed in order to move the resurfacing project forward. Currently our crews are working on Sylvan Street in preparation of concrete construction which will start shortly. 
 
When these roadwork projects happen, every attempt is made to replace any tree that has been removed during the next planting cycle. The Shade Tree Commission and DPW tree crew collaborate to determine the best types of trees to use as replacements, and favor species that have proven to thrive in Rutherford. 
 
As this is the “Borough of Trees,” we are careful to remove trees only when it is absolutely necessary. If our personnel feel the tree can be saved, it is policy to take all measures possible to do so. 

Sincerely, 

Chris Seidler

Public Works Superintendent
