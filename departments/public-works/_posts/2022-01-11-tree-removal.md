Tree Removal at Tamblyn Field

The DPW has removed a large oak tree behind Diamond 1 at Tamblyn Field. A major crack in the tree trunk was likely to worsen and split completely, possibly resulting in catastrophic damage. These actions were approved by the Shade Tree Commission. The area will be rehabilitated in the spring. 

In addition, all the oak trees that are growing along the west side of the drive way will have dead limbs removed and the canopy pruned. Several smaller trees farther down the driveway will be removed due to poor condition and other hazards. The area will be improved and re-landscaped in the spring.
