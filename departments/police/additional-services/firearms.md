# Firearms Application

[**PLEASE READ: Instructions for Applying for a Firearms Permit**](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.rutherford-nj.com/police/New%20NJ%20Portal%20Directions.pdf)

The new online application is APPLICANT DRIVEN. If you as the applicant makes a mistake while applying, you can simply RE-APPLY. You applicant should understand that all application fees are non-refundable and non-transferable. You MUST utilize the correct ORI for the correct Police Department (see below). Most of the ISSUES INCURRED/CREATED by the APPLICANT during the online application process are unable to be altered after submission and will be reviewed on a case by case basis. After determination that the error occurred on the applicantâ€™s side, the Police Department has the discretion to instruct the applicant to re-apply.

For firearms applicants that have resided outside of New Jersey within the last ten years, please complete the Mental Health Release Authorization form and return a signed copy to the Rutherford Police Detective Bureau:
