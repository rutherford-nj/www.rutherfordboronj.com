The Records Bureau’s main responsibilities are to securely store, retrieve, distribute and dispose of police reports. Police reports consist of investigation reports, supplement reports, motor vehicular crashes, property reports, arrests, and miscellaneous incident reports. All reports are assigned a “case number” and are maintained numerically.

The Records Bureau’s front counter is open to the public Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and will be closed weekends and holidays. The Records Bureau is located on the 1st Floor of the Police Department Headquarters located at 18 Donaldson Avenue.  

Copies of reports may be requested in person or via the phone, mail or email.  Discovery can be requested by mail, email or fax. OPRA requests are handled through the Borough Clerk’s office located at 176 Park Avenue. 

It is recommended that you call before requesting a report to confirm that the report has been received in the Records Bureau and/or if it can be released. Please provide case number or as much information as possible with your request. It should be noted that many reports cannot be released except in person with a photo ID and/or sensitive information may be redacted.
