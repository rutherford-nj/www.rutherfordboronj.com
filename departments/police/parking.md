**RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT INFORMATION** 

All current residential parking permits that expired will remain active indefinitely. No new issuance or alterations of a parking permit will be needed for valid permits previously issued. 

Newly issued license plates, transfer of license plates, and the lease or purchase of a new vehicle require a new application. 

Please e-mail all Residential Parking Program applications, including new and modifications for a transfer of license plates, and questions to traffic@rutherfordpd.com

An application received without all required documentation will not be processed.

An application received from a non-resident will be denied.  Your driverâ€™s license must reflect your Rutherford home address.  The only exclusion is business issued permits.
