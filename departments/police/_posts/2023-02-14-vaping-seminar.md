Both the CDC and U.S. Surgeon Generalhave desperately labeled teen vaping an EPIDEMIC. If your child is approaching the 5th grade or higher, you can no longer afford to ignore this potentially devastating threat to your family’s future. 

Hidden behind a thin veil of harm-reduction and commercial propaganda, Teen Vaping has subtlety grown to become our nation’s number one drug threat for teens. Many parents express uncertainty and confusion on this critical topic. It’s time we broke through that. Timothy Shoemaker MS will help you address this issue before it becomes a problem!
