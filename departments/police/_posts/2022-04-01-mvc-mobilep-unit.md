The Mobile Unit can serve up to 40 customers, with an additional 10 customers to be placed on a standby list.

Currently, NJMVC can process up to 12 REAL ID customers, anything more than that, customers would have to be placed on a stand-by list.  REAL ID customers are asked to appear from 10 am to 11:30 am, if you report past noon it’s likely NJMVC will not be able to serve you. 

License renewal/REAL ID upgrades - your driver’s license MUST be within six (6) months of expiration at the date of the event.
