Participants may dispose of medication in its original container or by removing the medication from its container and disposing of it directly into the disposal box. If an original container is submitted, the individual should be encouraged to remove any identifying information from the prescription label. 

All solid dosage pharmaceutical product and liquids in consumer containers may be accepted. Liquid products, such as cough syrup, should remain sealed in their original container. The depositor should ensure that the cap is tightly sealed to prevent leakage. 

Intra-venous solutions, injectables, and syringes will NOT be accepted due to potential hazard posed by blood-borne pathogens. 

Vape pens or other e-cigarette devices: ONLY after the batteries are removed from the devices.  If the battery cannot be removed, individual consumers can check with large electronic chain stores who may accept the vape pen or e-cigarette devices for proper disposal.
