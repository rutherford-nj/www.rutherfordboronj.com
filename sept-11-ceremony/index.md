**Rutherford Remembers Port Authority Police Officer Maurice Barry**

>Port Authority Police Officer Maurice Barry was affectionately known as “Moe.” Officer Barry served this community as an Ambulance Corps member and a Boy Scout Leader. He was known to always help a neighbor or a stranger in need. Although reluctant to speak of his good deeds and acts of heroism, he served as a member of the Port Authority Police Department’s Emergency Services Unit. Port Authority Police Officer and hero Moe Barry selflessly gave his life on September 11th trying to rescue others.

**Rutherford Remembers John Crowe**

>John Crowe was a devoted husband and father, known for his charitable nature. He served this community as a coach for Rutherford Basketball, Rutherford Baseball Council, and the Babe Ruth League. He was also active in the alumni associations of St. Peter's Prep and St. Peter's College and the Jersey City Chapter of Rebuilding Together. In memory of his charitable nature friends and family volunteered in the construction of a house with Habitat for Humanity and a scholarship fund has been established in his name at St. Peter's Prep. His niece Jennifer Van Blarcom produced the conceptual design for our lasting memorial to those lost from Rutherford on Sept. 11, 2001.

>Tim Finnerty was known for his generosity of spirit and his love of basketball. While in Rutherford, he played CYO basketball for St. Mary’s and later coached CYO basketball in Glen Rock at St. Catherine’s. To honor him, his friends and family approached the Borough to renovate the courts at Tamblyn Field that he loved and used so much while growing up here. Now the children of Rutherford play where he once played. A “Good Sportsmanship” award is presented to an 8 th grade boy and girl in the Recreation basketball program who demonstrates Tim Finnerty’s character.

**Rutherford Remembers John Griffin**

>John Griffin was a graduate of St. Mary’s School and always considered Rutherford his “true home town”. He played on St. Mary’s 1981 State Champions football team. John’s personality and outgoing nature made him many friends. He and his wife June created the “Hope with Heart” organization, which supports children with heart defects, after the death of their son Jonathan. He was a founding member of the Torch Foundation which supports various children’s charities and shared his home and his family with inner-city children by supporting the Fresh Air Fund. 

**Rutherford Remembers Ronnie Breitweiser**

>Ronnie Breitweiser was devoted to his family and his career as a portfolio manager. Described as quiet and focused well beyond his years, Ronnie was an honor
student at Rutherford High School. A 1980 graduate, Ronnie was truly a Rutherford Success story. His love of Rutherford during his years in this community is noted by all who knew him. His enduring Rutherford friendships were a testimony of the man he became.

**Rutherford Remembers Port Authority Police Officer Paul Laszczynski**

>Port Authority Police Officer Paul Laszczynski was known for his love of his two daughters, Amy and Jennifer, and his love of motorcycles.

As a member of the Port Authority Emergency Services Unit, he received several awards for acts of heroism. On September 11th, he gave his life in rescuing others.
