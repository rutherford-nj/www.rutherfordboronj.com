The Rutherford Farmer’s Market is returning for its 24th season. The market is sponsored by the Borough of Rutherford. The governing body welcomes the opportunity to support regional farmers by allowing them to market quality products in our downtown area.  These markets provide the economic activity necessary to help preserve farmland, open space and a better quality of life in our region.  

Our borough benefits because market patrons have access to fresh, high quality produce and our local businesses enjoy increased business activity.

As restrictions ease, the Borough requests that both vendors and patrons observe remaining NJ Department of Health and CDC public health guidelines and employ hygienic practices around food and other people at all times.

Vendors for this year include:

• Sy Grisconis Farm – Fresh produce

• Dr. Pickle – Pickles and brine cured products – Wednesdays

Check back regularly as vendors are added!
