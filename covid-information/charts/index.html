    Below are charts created to help understand the spread of COVID-19 within Rutherford, comparing Rutherford to other regions.
    The charts on this page were created by the Data & Analytics committee.

<p>
  On Friday March 18th, 2022 the Borough began reporting COVID cases weekly instead of daily.
  As we have continued to monitor the spread of COVID through the town and region, we have decided to no longer report local cases.
  Rutherford case counts have proportionally followed Bergen County case counts.
  For continued monitoring of the spread of COVID in the region we suggest following
  Bergen County information through the <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/">State of New Jersey reporting site</a>,
  or sites such as <a href="https://covidactnow.org/us/new_jersey-nj/county/bergen_county/">Covid Act Now</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Rutherford health department will continue monitoring
  COVID-19 cases. In the event that the numbers do not align with
  Bergen County, a notification will be sent out to the Rutherford
  residents.

<p>
  <a href="#rutherford-covid-data-table">Rutherford data</a> comes from the Rutherford Health Department.
</p>
<p>
  All other data comes from the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">New York Times</a>, based on reports from state and local health agencies.
