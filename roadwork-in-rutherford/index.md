## SUEZ Road Work in Rutherford Fall 2022


[**SUEZ Roadwork Schedule December 5 - December 9**](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.rutherford-nj.com/road-work/Dewcon%20Rutherford%20Schedule%20for%2012-5-22%20thru12-9-22.pdf)

SUEZ is working in Rutherford streets as part of the company’s ongoing project to remove the remaining lead from the system. 

SUEZ has identified roughly 500 service lines in the borough that potentially contain lead. Over the next several months, crews will be digging at these locations to determine the material in those pipes.

Service lines are pipes that run from the water main in the street to an individual home. SUEZ owns the portion of the service line from the main to the curb, while the property owner is responsible for the portion from the curb to the home. While the water leaving the treatment plant does not contain lead, a lead service line could allow lead to get into your drinking water. 

If you would like to check what SUEZ has in its records about your service line, please go to [https://www.mysuezwater.com/njwq](https://www.mysuezwater.com/njwq). Click here [https://www.mysuezwater.com/customer-survey](https://www.mysuezwater.com/customer-survey) if you have replaced your service line or know the material of your line so SUEZ can update its records.

If a crew checks your line, you will be notified of the results. You will also receive advance notice of any further work that may occur, including: 

If the company portion of the service line contains lead and the property owner’s side is made of a different material, SUEZ will replace the pipe. 

If the service line on both the SUEZ side and the homeowner’s side are found to contain lead, SUEZ will notify you and ask whether you would like to replace your portion of the line at the same time. The replacement of your side will be at your expense since the property owner owns that portion of the pipe. If you choose to replace, SUEZ will coordinate its replacement with that of your plumber.

If both sides are lead and you do not want to replace your portion, SUEZ will not replace their side, as doing so could exacerbate any lead issue. To be effective, both SUEZ and the homeowner would need to take action. However, if your street is scheduled for repaving this year, SUEZ will have to proceed with the replacement of their line. 

SUEZ has spent more than $65 million in the past two years and has committed another $20 million this year to tackle the lead issue on many fronts. Crews working six days a week have already removed more than 5,300 lines in 47 municipalities. Water quality experts have installed cutting-edge testing equipment and enhanced water treatment. Thousands of customers have taken advantage of the company’s offer to test the water inside their homes for free. 

While work continues in the streets, SUEZ encourages residents to take a closer look inside their homes and address potential lead safety issues. Lead plumbing, lead solder in copper piping joints, faucets that contain lead, even grounding electric wires to lead pipes can cause elevated lead levels in the water. 

Thank you for your patience as SUEZ works to provide our community with safe, reliable drinking water.
