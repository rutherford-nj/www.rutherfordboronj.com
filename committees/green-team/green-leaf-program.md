# Green Leaf Business Recognition Program

## Overview

The Rutherford Green Leaf program is the Borough’s way of recognizing, supporting, and promoting businesses  that  make a commitment to sustainability. The program also aims to educate businesses on sustainable practices that help in saving money, minimizing risk, and gaining competitive advantages.
In order to become a member of the program, a business must describe their current and pledged sustainability efforts:
* **<span class="green-team-green">Five sustainable business actions</span>** from 11 topic categories
  * Four of these actions **<span class="green-team-green">must</span>** be in specific topic areas we feel are best suited for Rutherford
  * A **<span class="green-team-green">measurable environmental benefit</span>** in one of the actions
  * A **<span class="green-team-green">quantifiable cost savings</span>** in one of the actions
 
We want the application process to be as simple as possible, so if you want to apply, or just learn more, please [contact the Green Team](mailto:GreenTeam@RutherfordBoroNJ.com). We’ll be happy to set up a time to sit down with you and go over the application process (this shouldn't take more than an hour of your time).
The [Rutherford Green Team](/committees/green-team/) also stands ready to assist our Green Leaf businesses in tapping into existing financial assistance, understanding the evolving regulatory environment and advising on simple changes that can make a lasting impact in our community.
 
## Requirements

The criteria used in our program  are  based on the [**<span class="green-team-green">New Jersey Sustainable Business Registry (NJSBR)</span>**](http://registry.njsbdc.com/), a free statewide program that is a partnership between the [**<span class="green-team-green">Rutgers’ New Jersey Small Business Development Centers (NJSBDC)</span>**](https://www.njsbdc.com/) and the [**<span class="green-team-green">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)</span>**](http://www.nj.gov/dep/). To be listed on this registry, a business must commit  to  five (5) actions in 11 categories (listed below)  including one (1) measurable environmental benefit and one (1) cost savings they experienced. Businesses need to re-register every two (2) years at which time they must add one (1) action and one (1) measurable result.

To qualify for the **<span class="green-team-green">Rutherford Green Leaf program</span>**, a business must commit to **<span class="green-team-green">four of the five NJSBR actions in the mandatory categories</span>** listed below, including the category of “Rutherford” where we require a business to  list how it complies with existing waste and recycling regulations and provides single-use items only upon request. Additionally, we’ve identified several “priority actions” that we feel are of high value to our town. These actions are not mandatory since they don’t apply to all businesses, but we feel that they deserve special emphasis and will be highlighted on the certification and on our town website.
