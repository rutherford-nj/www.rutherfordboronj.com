# Rutherford Earns Sustainable Jersey Certification

Thanks to the efforts of the Green Team Committee, Rutherford has met the rigorous requirements to achieve [Sustainable Jersey certification at the silver-level.](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/certification/certification-overview/) Certified towns were announced at the Sustainable Jersey Annual Luncheon on November 14, 2023, in Atlantic City at the New Jersey State League of Municipalities Conference. [Sustainable Jersey's participating communities](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/certification/search-participating-municipalities-approved-actions/) represent over 83% of the state's municipalities. 

“The Green Team is one of the finest groups of volunteers we have in Rutherford. Their dedication and commitment to sustainability is apparent in everything they do. I’m proud to have them here to educate and lead by example, not only for our residents but for other towns,” said Mayor Frank Nunziato. 

For the 2023 Sustainable Jersey application cycle, 20 towns achieved certification at the more advanced silver-level to make a total of 70 towns that are silver-certified in the program. Silver-level certification requires that a town meet a minimum of 350 points. Rutherford achieved and impressive 375 points across 33 actions in 9 different categories, including 5 priority actions.

The Green Team focused on Health, Energy, Arts and Food and Waste Actions, which accounted for 35% of the total points received. This was a huge collaborative effort, as it wouldn’t have been possible without all the Borough employees and committee members as well as other volunteers who worked with the Green Team to compile a tremendous amount of data.

“We’re proud to recognize the 2023 award winners and certified towns who have made sustainability an integral part of their municipality,” said Randall Solomon, director of Sustainable Jersey. “Thank you for your leadership, hard work and vision. You exemplify the commitment we need to achieve a sustainable New Jersey.” Certified towns excelled in areas such as improving energy efficiency, health and wellness, reducing waste, sustaining local economies, protecting natural resources and advancing the arts.
