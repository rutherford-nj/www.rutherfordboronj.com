          The Rutherford Arts Committee is dedicated to the promotion of arts throughout the Borough. In recent years, the Arts Committee has created avenues and increased visibility for local musicians and visual artists. The Arts Committee works closely with the Recreation Department to bring arts programming to Rutherford residents of all ages.

        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold"> • PorchFest</span><br>
        The Arts Committee is excited to make the long talked about PorchFest a reality in 2023! Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all             sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee is currently               seeking homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a             fantastic community event. Rutherford's PorchFest 2023 will take place on Saturday, November 4th with a rain date of Sunday, November 5th.

        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold"> • Clara's Tunnel</span><br>
        Clara's Tunnel is a pedestrian thoroughfare connecting Park Avenue to public parking at the Kip Garage on Kip Avenue. The Arts Committee              collaborated with Borough officials to maintain an arts component in the 2022 Clara’s Tunnel renovation project. These display cases are used         to feature multidisciplinary local artists and artwork - from students, residents and beyond.
        Public art is integral to community building. Art is accessible to everyone - it is a way to foster connection and a sense of identity, it           expresses community values, and it beautifies spaces. We look forward to bringing Rutherford ’s myriad artistic talent to this space in the            future. For more information email Kim Bogosian at communications@rutherfordboronj.com.
