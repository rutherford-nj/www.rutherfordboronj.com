          The Rutherford Arts Committee is dedicated to the promotion of arts throughout the Borough. In recent years, the Arts Committee has created avenues and increased visibility for local musicians and visual artists. The Arts Committee works closely with the Recreation Department to bring arts programming to Rutherford residents of all ages.

        Clara's Tunnel is a pedestrian thoroughfare connecting Park Avenue to public parking at the Kip Garage on Kip Avenue. The Arts Committee              collaborated with Borough officials to maintain an arts component in the 2022 Clara’s Tunnel renovation project. These display cases are used         to feature multidisciplinary local artists and artwork - from students, residents and beyond.

        Public art is integral to community building. Art is accessible to everyone - it is a way to foster connection and a sense of identity, it           expresses community values, and it beautifies spaces. We look forward to bringing Rutherford ’s myriad artistic talent to this space in the            future. For more information email Kim Bogosian at communications@rutherfordboronj.com.

          The Green Team advocated the Borough the adoption of a Complete Streets policy that was adopted on March
          22, 2011. The policy requires that all modes of transportation and mobility be considered during the safe
          planning of road and sidewalk improvements whether that be walking, biking, public transit or motorized means.
          In 2014 a Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan was completed that identified improvements that could be made to Borough
          Streets, several of which have now been adopted including bike lanes, improved cross walks and improved
          visibility at intersections.
