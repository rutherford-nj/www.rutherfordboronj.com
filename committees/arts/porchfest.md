This year we're doubling the music and doubling the fun! 

Festivities begin at 9:00 am with youth bands at Lincoln Park followed by 2 simultaneous loops of live music on 15 different porches throughout town!

**A bus will be available to shuttle between porches and public restrooms at 184 Park Ave (Old Police Station, Donaldson Ave Entrance).** 



Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee will seek homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a fantastic community event.
