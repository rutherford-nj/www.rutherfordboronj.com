# PorchFest 2024 - Saturday June 15th! 

The Arts Committee currently making plans for PorchFest 2024. 

[I'd like to volunteer my TIME to help out with PorchFest 2024 - Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/wseQgpynohPjiVsH6)

Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee will seek homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a fantastic community event.
