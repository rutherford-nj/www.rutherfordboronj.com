# PorchFest 2024 - Saturday June 15th! 

[**Check out the map of bands and houses!**](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.rutherford-nj.com/committees/arts/PorchFest_2024_Map.pdf)

This year we're doubling the music and doubling the fun! Two simultaneous loops of porches and bands thoughout town will make for a great all-day event!


[I'd like to volunteer my TIME to help out with PorchFest 2024 - Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/wseQgpynohPjiVsH6)

Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee will seek homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a fantastic community event.
