# PorchFest 2023 - Saturday, November 4th 

The Arts Committee is excited to make the long talked about PorchFest a reality in 2023! 

Originated in Ithaca, NY, in 2007, towns of all sizes throughout the country have recreated this successful music festival in their own ways. The Rutherford Arts Committee is currently seeking homeowners willing to lend their porches and lawn, musicians to lend their talents and volunteers to lend their time to create a fantastic community event. Rutherford's PorchFest 2023 will take place on Saturday, November 4th with a rain date of Sunday, November 5th.
