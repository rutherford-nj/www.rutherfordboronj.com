          <strong>ORIGINS</strong><br>
          The Rutherford Civil Rights Commission (RCRC) is a Mayor-appointed Commision composed of Rutherford citizens who put into practice the intent and                spirit of federal and state civil rights laws. The first organization of its kind in Bergen County, it was founded in 1964 by former Borough                     Councilman, Robert E. Wesp whose pioneering maxim, “Do justice, show mercy, walk humbly.” formed the bedrock of the Commission’s current purpose to             help protect our diverse community’s civil rights.<br>  
          Today, the Commission is governed by a set of By-Laws authorized by the Borough of Rutherford and in accordance with N.J.S.A. 10:5-10 – the New Jersey             Law Against Discrimination. See References for a copy of our By-Laws.
