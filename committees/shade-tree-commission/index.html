          The Borough of Rutherford Shade Tree Commission promotes the conservation and stewardship of trees throughout
          the Borough by advising and working with Borough officials, the Department of Public Works and Shade Tree
          Division regarding the planting, care and maintenance of public property trees. It is our heritage,
          responsibility and commitment for a long term investment in the beauty, health and character of our tree
          canopy throughout Rutherford.

          As part of this year’s Arbor Day celebration, the Rutherford Shade Tree Commission coordinated the planting of
          a large Linden tree at Borough Hall, in honor of long-time resident Marianne Coston. Marianne was a great
          supporter of the Brough of Trees and for the care and protection of the historic tree canopy in which she
          spent her life. She advocated the re-establishment of a Shade Tree Commission, and had great encouragement for
          the citizens who devoted their time and resources to its relaunch. - Video by Alex Fiume
