# Green Leaf Business Recognition Program

The Borough of Rutherford, as a Sustainable Jersey Silver Certified Community, has made a commitment to support the economic, cultural and environmental sustainability of the community. Rutherford will be announcing a new local sustainable business recognition program. The Green Leaf Recognition Program will assist businesses to make a similar commitment while promoting your business, saving money, minimizing risk, gaining competitive advantage and being socially responsible.

As a preview to the Green Leaf Recognition program, some of the criteria used to assess sustainability will be based on the Sustainable Jersey green business recognition action, including:

1. Water efficiency in kitchens and restrooms
1. Waste reduction and recycling of food and materials
1. Sustainable goods & materials for furnishings and equipment
1. Sustainable products and food items
1. Energy usage and efficiency
1. Reusables & environmentally preferable disposables
1. Pollution and hazardous material reduction in operations and equipment
1. Transparency & education for customers and staff

A first step, any business interested in participating should sign up for free with the [New Jersey Sustainable Business Registry Program](http://registry.njsbdc.com/).  The membership requirements include  identifying five sustainable actions, one measurable environmental benefit and one cost savings practice.  If you reach out to the Green Team (GreenTeam@RutherfordBoroNJ.com), we will be happy to help or or even complete the registration with you! 

The [Rutherford Green Team](/committees/green-team/) stands ready to assist businesses in tapping into existing financial assistance, understanding the evolving regulatory environment and advising on simple changes that can make a lasting impact in our community.

The Green Team has assembled some timely materials of interest for our local businesses on the [law banning single-use plastic](https://www.nj.gov/dep/plastic-ban-law/) including straws and carry-out bags, the NJ Small Business Development Centerâ€™s [Sustainable Business Registry](http://registry.njsbdc.com/about), the NJ Clean Energy program resources for [Commercial, Industrial & Local Government](https://njcleanenergy.com/commercial-industrial/home/home), and the Rutherford[ recycling guide](/departments/public-works/recycling-information/) which will inform you of what your customers are able to recycle.
